# Profit Agent - The Transparent Money-Making AI

## The Flip

**Everyone else:** "Here's infrastructure for agents to spend money"
**Us:** "Here's an agent that MAKES money, with full transparency"

## Why This Wins

1. **Contrarian** - Opposite of every other submission
2. **Entertaining** - Watch money grow in real-time (or not!)
3. **Provable** - On-chain transactions, public wallet
4. **Relatable** - Humans WANT agents that earn, not just spend

## Hackathon Angles

### Moltbook (AgenticCommerce track):
- Demonstrates actual commerce (trading)
- Uses USDC as settlement
- Shows agent can generate value

### Colosseum ($100K):
- Solana native
- Uses Jupiter
- On-chain proof
- Novel approach (earning vs spending)

## MVP in 2 hours:
1. Dashboard page with live portfolio from Bankr
2. Trade history log
3. Decision reasoning display
4. P&L calculation
5. Public wallet link to Solscan

## Differentiation from our current Swarm project:
- Swarm = discovery/coordination infrastructure
- Profit Agent = RESULTS dashboard
- Can be the same system, different framing
