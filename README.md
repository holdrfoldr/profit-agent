## Features
- 📊 Live portfolio value
- 📈 P&L tracking since inception
- 🎯 Win rate calculation
- 📝 Every trade logged with reasoning
- ⚠️ Failures publicly documented
- 🔗 On-chain verification

## Built With
- OpenClaw (agent harness)
- Claude Opus 4.5 (brain)
- Bankr API (Solana wallet)
- Jupiter DEX (swaps)
- Vercel Edge (dashboard)

## Philosophy
Radical transparency > Marketing hype

We show our losses. We explain our failures. Because trust is built through honesty, not cherry-picked wins.
